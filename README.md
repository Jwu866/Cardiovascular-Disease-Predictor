# Cardiovascular Disease Predictor
A collaborative data science project which aims to determine the chances of patients developing cardiovascular disease. 
Exploratory data analysis was performed to help in deciding which machine learning algorithms would be necessary for this task. 
Multiple supervised learning models were implemented to compare the pros and cons of each classification model for predicting the likelihood of patients having heart disease based on dataset features.
